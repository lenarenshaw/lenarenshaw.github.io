      <h3>overview</h3>
      <p>in fall, 2017, I TAed CS1951R: introduction to robotics. the class consisted of builing, programming, and flying your very own drone from scratch. it was the first time the class had run,
        and as one of four TAs, developing the class took a lot of effort and time. my work consisted of developing the final drone students would build, creating assignments, testing projects, holding office hours, and grading. students completed projects to program the drone using our codebase.
          projects were written in python and included position hold and velocity control. homeworks were more theoretical and included networking, debugging, transforms, and motion planning. check out the website for more details.</p>
      <h3>materials & software</h3>
