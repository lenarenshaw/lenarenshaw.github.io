      <h3>overview</h3>
      <p>in a team of four, I worked on a project to analyze trends in crime data in providence, ri. this project aimed to answer a set of predictive and analytical questions using crime data in Providence, RI. predictive questions include: when, where, and what will the next crime in Providence be, and can one predict whether a crime will result in an arrest? analytical questions mainly surround how factors such as geography, income, race, and more impacts cases and arrests. this project deals with crime data provided by the Providence Police Department. for the most part, we made measurable progress towards this idea. we were able to correctly predict whether a case would turn into an arrest 94% of the time from the dataset that we had, with 73% precision on predicted arrests, but we did not do this for cases in the future. this was because by the time we had created the logistic regression model, there was not enough time left to get a significant sampling of data to make these predictions. so, we split our dataset into training and testing sets and performed the logistic regression on the testing sample. We also focused more on discovering trends in the data, which can be seen in our chi-squared analysis and visualizations.</p>
