      <h3>design</h3>
      <p>this is a side table i designed.</p>
      <h3>process</h3>
      <p>i first made several drawings of this table, followed by many cardboard prototypes. however, cutting and assembling the wood itself was much more challenging than any one of these prototypes. though the design didn't change much iteration to iteration, the final product was slightly different than I imagined, with the pieces slotting into one another differently in the wood version versus the cardboard version.</p>
      <h3>materials & software</h3>
      <p>wood, table saw, nail gun, glue</p>
